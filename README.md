# ModularRobotSelfAssembly 
Welcome to this repository! This is the source code of our proposed modular robot self-assembly algorithm.
We consider the self-assembly problem as a time-varying online Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problem.

The code will be uploaded after the acceptance of the submitted conference.
